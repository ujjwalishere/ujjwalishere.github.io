![My Image](/images/ujjwal.jpeg)

I am Ujjwal, currently an undergraduate student at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru; Majoring in Environmental Science and Sustainability. 

I can not say I am something or the other because I feel like i am not good at anything. Sometimes I code, write poetry, play volleyball, click some beautiful pictures, just explore some random topic like "Matrioshka brain or Ligo". I like opening things up and looking up what inside them or repairing broken old things. 

I thrive on exploring real world challenges and solving them by things I learn in classroom. I try to learn new things and explore world without the presumption of achieving something from that knowledge. I think this is what me makes me human. 


I hope this place will give you a little peek into my world and hopefully you will learn more about some new things.
