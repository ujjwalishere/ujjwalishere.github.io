Currently undergrad in **Environmental Science & Sustainability** but always a curious, tinkering being. Learning how to learn, trying to solve today's problems, and hoping for a better world tomorrow.

Here, I share everything, that needs to be known:

- Writing, Readings and about what Iâ€™m learning
- Experiments, projects, and side quests
- Things that matter to me: drawings, music etc.
