An undergrad in **Environmental Science & Sustainability** who also explores code, poetry, photography, audio mixes, and repairing / tinkering with old things.

This little corner is where I put:

- Writing, Readings and about what Iâ€™m learning
- Experiments, projects, and side quests
- Creative mixes: music, photos, drawings, and more
