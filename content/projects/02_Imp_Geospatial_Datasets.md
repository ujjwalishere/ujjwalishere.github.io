This will be an an ever updating list, as I explore new datasets, processing tools and techniques. It is based on what I found useful in my research and projects not a comprehensive list.

> I do not include proprietary and commercial stuff here but there are a lot out there, some of them quite good.

# General Processing

# Data Sources


## Shapes, Boundaries and Elevation

### [GADM](https://gadm.org/)

   Useful for getting boudaries for countries, and their subdivisions. Subdivision can vary depending on country.

### [Indian Boundaries](https://onlinemaps.surveyofindia.gov.in/Digital_Product_Show.aspx)

   If working on a project in India, use these official boundaries provided by the survey of India. Scroll to Administrative boundaries 
   and you will find boundaries for district level, taluk level, village level etc. Boundaries are free but other datasets are chargeable.

### [GeoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/)

   Database of political and Administrative boundaries around the globe. Very easy to download, simplified files are also available.

### [GAUL](https://data.apps.fao.org/catalog/organization/administrative-boundaries-fao)

Provided by the Food and Agriculture organisation *FAO* of the United Nations. It is sourced from various UN agencies and government organisations etc and then combined together. Learn more about it from [here](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/aebf0333-a0e3-4177-9d4a-bb2472d0367e)

### [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)

Useful for making maps, endorsed by North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS).
