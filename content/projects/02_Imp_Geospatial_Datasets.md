Stepping into the world of GIS, you become surrounded by uncountable number of tools, datasets and lot of formats.It is a daunting task to figure out which is which. I made this documentation for myself to keep a well organized list of all the things which I found useful in my research and projects. I will keep updating this as I find new things.
