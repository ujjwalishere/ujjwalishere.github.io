When I was a kid, somebody told me that the Earth is round. I was amazed, but it took me years to properly digest that ideaâ€”not just one or two years, but many years. Still, I am making sense of that idea today, but how can it be like a ball? It looks pretty flat to me. I used to climb my terrace, curious about finding the curvature of the earth, but to no avail. There are a lot of people who still believe that the earth is flat, and I don't think that they are stupid, as some might assume them to be. I found this really cool website about something called [Flat Earth Society](https://www.tfes.org/). I liked the questions people asked in the forum.

Apart from these interesting discussions, Earth really is not flat. Does that mean it is round, and if it is round, then is it perfectly round? From the [pictures taken from space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_first_images_of_Earth_from_space), it seems perfectly round, right? It definitely looks perfectly spherical, and that is the case from all the pictures taken from space.

## What is the shape of the Earth?

In reality, the earth is not round like a sphere; it is actually some weird shape, something called ["Geoid"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid). It looks something like the image below; it is an exaggerated figure, but it does show that the earth is not exactly round; it is kind of like a lumpy sphere. I know that this is not what comes to mind when we imagine Earth. The thing is, figuring out the shape of the Earth is a more challenging task, which can not be just solved by taking pictures from afar.

The problem with the Earth is that it is not a fixed sphere; it is constantly changing its shape all the time, with the movements of tides, ocean waves, clouds, tectonic plates, etc. So, determining the exact shape is difficult, but you need to come up with a shape that is somewhat constant, at least most of the time. The field for studying the Earth's shape is called Geodesy, and geodesists have been trying to measure the exact shape of the Earth to this day.

One of the methods they use to measure the Earth's shape is using its gravity.. It is a clever technique to figure out shape, since the mass of the Earth remains constant and does not change position in short lengths of time. This mass is unevenly distributed, so that gravity in different places is going to vary. If we can measure these variations and imagine the Earth as a sphere of water, the shape that water will eventually take is going to be the approximate shape, right? To simplify, it depends on how dense the Earth is under your feet.

With modern satellites like [GRACE](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grace/) and [GOCE](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/goce), we have measured the gravity along the surface of the earth, and the picture above is the most accurate geoid we have come up with till now.

There are a few important observations here,

-   The Earth is bulged around the equator, squished on the poles. This means that you'll have more weight on poles as compared to the equator because of the distance from the centre of the Earth.
-   If you try to fit this shape into some form of sphere, it closely resembles an oblate sphere, bulged around the equator; this bulge is a little below the equator, not exactly on the equator.
-   The gravitational constant is not $9.8 m/s^2$ all over the earth; it differs.
-   There are places on Earth that have very high gravitational anomalies, like the Indian Ocean, which shows very anomalous gravity.

But whether you want to consider the earth as a spheroid, ellipsoid, or geoid, it all depends on what you are trying to achieve. For navigational purposes, the geoid makes life difficult, so we use a spheroid; for our normal globe models, a sphere works fine. If you really want an accurate shape for weather modelling, tracking water resources, or studying the Earth, then a geoid is helpful.

*For now, I can say that the earth is spherical enough to say that it is a sphere, rather than flat enough to say it otherwise.*

## How did I get into all of this?

For the past semester, I have been doing a course in GIS. I've come across maps, projections, and datum earlier, but I only knew what to do in GIS software and had a broad idea of how these all work. Right now, I'm really curious about geodesy and have spent quite a lot of time on this. It is interesting to know how things work behind the scenes. I know I have just scratched the surface for now, but at least now I know what I do not know. Right now, I am spending a lot of time learning projections and GPS, about which I have come up with some cool things. I'll try to share that as soon as I find time. This semester is the most interesting one; I am learning so many interesting new things that I don't have time to write about them.
