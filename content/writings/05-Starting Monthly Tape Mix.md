I listen a lot of music, for me it is like having some sweet after the dinner; Can live without it but don't want to live without it. My listening habits are quite diverse and is not constrained by anything. I have lot of carefully crafted playlist and I thought it will not do any good if I keep it to myself. So I have decided that I will be sharing 10 songs, music, tunes, beats, etc. every month starting today. I will try my best to be consistent in this endeavour as possibly as I can. I have decided this to give a title: *Monthly Tape Mix.*

My main platform for music is Spotify but I hate Spotify and today I found another reason. I tried to embed my songs into this page but it shows only preview, it makes music tik-toki which I do not want. I remember earlier it was not like that, this is their new trick, I used to love Spotify but that love is a fading love now. I am sure a day will come when we part our ways. I'll try my best dear reader to not cause you too much inconvenience but I do not own these music platform. Maybe I will make my own one day and it will be totally open source, for now bear with me.

So, 
Monthly Tape Mix: March 2025

# 1. White Noize - Bonaparte

I never watched the video of this one, I used to enjoy the music and lyrics until today and this song is trying to say something. I do not endorse anything shown in the video at all.
