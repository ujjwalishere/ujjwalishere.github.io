Umm, I have mixed feelings about this book because it's touching on a subject that is close to my heart. One problem is that when something is very dear to you, you become hyper-focused on every detail of it; maybe that is what is causing it.

It was a fictional piece, but an effort to be relevant in the real world. Bit long it was, but I enjoyed reading it.

The story was set in the future, where humanity is struggling with problems caused by today's humans and trying to deal with them. The Story starts in India, where we faced deadly heatwaves and a lot of people had died. India is preparing to deploy a geoengineering experiment to protect its citizens. In our story, a man named Frank was working in Lucknow when the heatwave hit. He saw people dying, power systems had failed, and people were getting cooked in the extreme heat. He got saved somehow, but the trauma kept haunting him. So, he decided to take down the people who are responsible. 
He tried to kidnap a woman named Mary, who was a very important figure in one of the UN agencies, to deal with such issues. He got caught by the police and was kept in Zurich. He spent the rest of his life in prison, but Mary started to visit him and tried to understand why he did what he did. Then she realised, and she fought to make the world a better place. The story ends with a hopeful world, still riddled with problems but also able to solve them.

The whole book is not like a linear story but consists of chapters, hopping from one scene to another. Each chapter paints one scene, then the story continues from some previous scenes. This was kind of like Nolan's movie type of story. This non-linearity made the story very engaging. 

This book goes into great detail about the economics, geopolitics, and science of climate change. I was amazed at how deeply the author delved into these issues. I think this might be one of the difficult tasks for the author, and I have little criticism here. Some details were exaggerated, and some problems were portrayed as easy to solve. Maybe its just me being too technical about my field of work. For any everyday being, it's a good book.

Overall, Good Read!
