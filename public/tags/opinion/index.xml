      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated with the radio, and I always was, although there are differing reason today and when I was a kid. I remember those old Ramsons radios which was like having an iPhone at that time. There were some brands I never figured out, but they also worked flawlessly, just a minor tradeoff in sound quality. I remember me figuring out the best place to figure out the best signal. Sometimes it used to work only if your body is in contact with the antenna, the second you remove your hand, it ruined your favorite song. I somehow figured out that if you rig the antenna of a radio with the TV antenna (&lt;em&gt;Yagi antenna-&lt;/em&gt; I did not know the name at that time) then it worked like a charm. All the channels that used to play modern songs like Red FM, Radio city etc.; frequencies were on my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then over time as TV got more popular and then phones, smartphones took over, the radio got lost, until one day I found one catching dust. It was a Ramsons model, but the string that connects tuner to external tuning knob was broken but overall, it was in good shape. I opened it, half of the solders had come out and half the wires I broke in the process. It used to work on the big D size batteries which is almost impossible to come by, but I got the info about the voltage, and I knew I can manage with a phone’s battery if I manage to solder one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/images/radio.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image of Radio&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first challenge was to figure out which wire goes where and that proved to be the most daunting task. I figured out the transistor model and then after a lot of google searches and research I found the schematics of it. It took some time to figure out what each component of the board does. It took me a few days to tweak connections and play with solder then one day I actually made it work. It was all static, no sound, no music or anything. I totally forgot about the antenna, I took a aluminum wire and used it as an antenna; and here we are, my radio was working. I was able to tune to like 4-5 channels, at night I got few more. I was so happy and for few days I only listened to it, my mom was thinking I had gone mad, but people do not realize that satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I did not manage to close it properly because the external tuner knob and the tuner inside had this complicated pully-spring kind of system and some parts of it were missing. Then I got busy with all the other stuff, and it again went catching dust somewhere. I had some plans to build my own radio from scratch someday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently got interested in radio again because I got tired of listening to the same kind of music. I realized that radio used to give you exposure to new and random music taste but now I am stuck in my own filter bubble. Whether I use Spotify, YouTube, whatever they are all same algorithms. It trapped me in my own music bubble, and I am tired of it. I wanted something new, something surprising and then I tuned to the radio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently I am playing around with an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;RadioGarden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although I have used it before but I am again gone back to using it. You get a map of a lot of radio stations around the world as little-little dots and then you can just play around. I found it so cool, not only do you find something new, but you also get to know what people are listening to around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found this channel called &lt;em&gt;Ujala Radio&lt;/em&gt; which is an Amsterdam, and I am addicted to it (&lt;em&gt;not because it bear resemblance to my name&lt;/em&gt;). First, I was surprised by a Hindi channel in Amsterdam until I realized there are many around the world. I looked for places in US, Canada because I knew that a lot of Indians live there, and I found more. I like radio garden, although sometimes ads are annoying but If I had money, I might have paid for it as well, but it does not interrupt your music like Spotify does. It also has a very beautiful website as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the channels I am listening to these days:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/listen/ujala/sCFHyXDN&#34;&gt;Ujala Radio&lt;/a&gt;                       &lt;em&gt;Amsterdam, Netherlands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/listen/radio-sbs/HASfWUI8&#34;&gt;Radio SBS&lt;/a&gt;                      &lt;em&gt;Utrecht, Netherlands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/listen/sangeet-radio-fm-95-1/3UYywf2B&#34;&gt;Sangeet Radio&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;em&gt;Houston, US&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/listen/radio-zindagi-am-540/zDDJjS8Z&#34;&gt;Radio Zindagi&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;em&gt;Edison, US&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/listen/radio-privet/AAtNsdFf&#34;&gt;Radio Privet&lt;/a&gt;               &lt;em&gt;Nytva, Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not just &lt;em&gt;RadioGarden&lt;/em&gt;; I am also playing with the local radio on my smartphone, but you need more patience for that because you can’t be moving around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>I&#39;ve finally got my own domain</title>
      <link>https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/posts/i-got-my-own-domain/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I was not particularly obsessed with my name, it’s just that I was curious about finding out how domain works. I have seen a lot of people doing their own thing on their website and I liked that idea. Your domain and website are something you own. I want to own my presence on the internet and here we are –&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ujjwalnagar.com&#34;&gt;www.ujjwalnagar.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I started, I thought it will be an easy task to buy a domain; Trust me it turned out to be more daunting than I thought. It took me almost two weeks, just to buy a domain. There are a ton of companies, we all have seen their constant stream of ads on YouTube&#xA;, websites etc. but if you start to investigate what they offer, you’ll get to know how murky this domain market is. You will find a lot of companies offering free domain, but when you see the checkout page, it says that you must buy for 3 years and the first year is free, scam it is “no?”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yearly price and renewal price are the first thing to look for, how much is their renewal price? And if there are conditions for it. Some of them don’t even let you buy a single year plan, most of the time it is bundled with hosting plans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Privacy is another thing to look for. Most of the registrars don’t even provide Whois redaction and privacy and these are two different things. If you don’t know, whois is basically a public directory which stores all the information related to domain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my friend recently bought a domain, I was curious, so I just did a whois lookup on his domain. All his personal information including his Name, Mobile number, Email address and his Address are publicly visible to anyone. I texted him about this, but he texted me back saying that he can’t remove it because that is a paid service, and he has to pay for it. This is common across most of the registrars, they will not tell you until you buy the domain and then you realize.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the same with SSL certificates. Most of these famous registrars sell SSL certificates as add on which can cost half the price of your domain itself. Same problem with this also, you will not realize until you buy the domain. Sometimes they will say free SSL buy there is always a little * attached to it. If you are asking yourself, why do I need a SSL certificate, I’ll explain it to you simply. Have you seen that screen in your browser when you are trying to load a website, and your browser warns you with scary screen that an attacker might hack your information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/images/attacker.png&#34; alt=&#34;Error Image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That happens because your site does not have an SSL certificate, and browsers can’t verify if it is a legit website or some spam. This again costs money, yes there are some sites that provide free SSL, but they don’t work. Most of these issues are with those registrars that spend so much on ads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to do Whois lookup on famous sites, which registrar they are using, then I did a lot of research on registrars on what they are offering, read a lot of reviews on reddit about different registrars. All this research led to Cloudflare; I was really surprised to know that you can buy domain from Cloudflare. I have used Cloudflare only for their DNS, but most people will remember Cloudflare for their “I am not robot” or website security verification banner that comes before you load a website. I found Cloudflare good, their documentation and everything was very clear and there was no colorful message to deceive you. Most of the domain costs around $10.5 which is cheap when you compare to other registrars and renewal is also constant for every successive year. Apart from this they also give you SSL and privacy redaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this seemed good but when I tried to purchase, I ran into payment issues. First it does not support Rupay card, only international cards are supported and PayPal. I’ve tried 4-5 credit, debit card everything nothing worked. I’ve raised a ticket no one replied. I asked in their community forum and on Discord server, one person replied but that was not helpful at all and then everyone stopped replying. After trying for 1 week every day, I decided to move on from Cloudflare. Later they emailed me all these issues are because of new RBI policies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I moved to Porkbun, they are the only second registrar I found that provides SSL and privacy. I tried to register through Porkbun but that also failed. So, they have this thing where you must scan your ID and take a selfie to get verified, it is all automated. It got rejected. I asked their support team they sent me another link to verify; again failed. I was really frustrated and at this point I wanted to drop my plan. This last time I wrote to them and Walla, they just directly approved my Id. After that it only took max 15 mins to purchase my domain. They use Stripe as their payment processor which works well and the funny part is Porkbun itself uses Cloudflare DNS. You also get email forwarding for your domain. So, my new email address will be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:contact@ujjwalnagar.com&#34;&gt;contact@ujjwalnagar.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ll later talk about how I point it to my website, how I am hosting it, CNAME records etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Hello, Internet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/images/flower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;flower&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about it for quite a while and today I have decided to give it a try. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a lot of conversation with one of my good friend Rishabh and he is the one to give me the final nudge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes! I am starting to write on the internet, you may call it a blog or whatever but for me it&amp;rsquo;s just a way to share ideas. This happened after a lot of debate with Rishabh, and I finally do agree that it is necessary to share ideas as he put it as emitting signals in the world of noise. I am more of a listening person and most of the time I do not have much to say. Problem is people talk a lot, and you need to be very careful to not miss the real part from all the noise. In midst of all of that, there is always very little time to say and even if you do want to say hardly anyone wants to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another problem is about opinions, we all have our own opinions, and every opinion matters even if you don&amp;rsquo;t agree with it but sometimes they are not welcomed. Here from time to time I will be sharing my opinions and thoughts on things, you do not have to necessarily agree with me, sometimes even I do not agree with my own. Although I will try my best but if my opinions do hurt anyone and are not at all acceptable, do point it out on my e-mail. Right now, I do not have any preplanned ideas what I am going to do here, you can take this as a place where I share. I am sure you will something worth reading here and hopefully It will contribute into something good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to 2025 and hope it will bring good days and joy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
