      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is inspired by &lt;em&gt;Tom Macwright&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s recently posts series, maybe a lot of my ideas about website are inspired by him. I enjoy reading his blogs and his ideas about website, which has also shaped this website. If you find some similarities in design, formats of posts like this one, all credits go to him. Do read his blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://macwright.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was busy past 2 weeks building and tweaking the layout of this website. It turned out to be more challenging than I thought but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally made some progress. After going back and forth, reading Hugo&amp;rsquo;s docs, I think got the overall idea how it works. Still there are a lot of things to learn and I am still learning everytime it throws some novel error on my face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Javascript is cool but it can be little hard to figure out on how to make it do what I want it to do. One of the biggest devil had become my friend now, it least in this scenario. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a lot of help from Copilot with GPT-5 model in it. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried it earlier with GPT-4.1 and some Claude models; that was a very frustrating experience. One issue here is that everytime I enter a prompt it feels like oh I&amp;rsquo;ve burned so much of planet to get this stupid code which doesn&amp;rsquo;t even run. GPT-5 works much better and gives you some useful thing. Although sometimes it is still frustrating to work with, especially when it hallucinates and, keep giving the same kind of output.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with LLM&amp;rsquo;s these days and will post seperately about my experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34;&gt;Watching&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve watched two movies &lt;strong&gt;Contact (1997) and Geostorm (2017)&lt;/strong&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I liked the &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;; It felt like another Interstellar but made in 1997. Since it was made in the year 1997, you can imagine the effort they&amp;rsquo;ve put into the movie without all those cool VFX we have these days. I also liked the overall plot of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ellie, the protagonist, who is an astronomer working for SETI (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seti.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Real organisation&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;), looking for life out there. Facing all the challenges for her research funding, one day she find out some strange radio signals coming from space. It turned out that aliens are trying to contact us. When this news got out, the government took control of the project. When they were not able to understand the messages, she helped them out and keep the project going. Aliens send the blue print for a machine that will allow them to their star Vega. Then all the politics, religion, human desires cause chaos. It talks about religion, science and how we can live in this vast empty universe. I later realised that this movie is based on Carl Sagan&amp;rsquo;s Novel named same as movie &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt; written in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did not liked the &lt;em&gt;Geostorm&lt;/em&gt; much because in the plot, things are put to the very extreme which I despise. I am leaned toward those movies in which story keep touch with some common sense. Although I love the underlying idea behind the movie about Geoenginerring, which is very relevant in present. Ideas about how Geoengineering projects can be weaponised is a really big concern will be one the biggest challenge if we were to ever try that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Geostorm&lt;/em&gt;, many countries have come together to build a weather controlling web of satellites surrounding the earth. It was headed by US. Just before they were about to hand it over to international community, things started to go wrong with system causing extreme events in some places of world. Two brothers one of which actually built the system and other one who works for the government tasked to figure out the problem. They race against time, finding the conspiracy behind the malfunctioning of system. If the system fails, it will cause a Geostorm, meaning extreme events around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie felt like hodgepodge and anything was happening with no sense behind it. I don&amp;rsquo;t like those kinds of movies where the protagonist need to survive at the cost of movie&amp;rsquo;s plot. One things which I would like to highlight, is the idea of Geoengineering. We&amp;rsquo;ve studied this idea in our 2nd semester and I literally gave a presentation about the same. It is proposed to be  one of the solution to our Climate Change problem but it can be dangerous especially when you don&amp;rsquo;t have a spare planet. This movie does depict some of those dangers but taken it to too extreme. Since it is a fictional, you can spare that. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about geo-engineering some other day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am still stuck on the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ministry of future&amp;rdquo; by Kim Stanly Robinson&lt;/em&gt;, which is taking more time than anticipated. It is getting interesting since I&amp;rsquo;ve finished half of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have following on my lineup but can change:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;1984 by George Orwell&lt;/em&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;ve read half it out, got stuck but it is still in my lineup.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Joy of X by Steven Strogatz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climate Change by Jason and Edmond&lt;/em&gt; - Read like starting 40 pages thrice. I will try to finish it soon.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten tired of those stupid laughing sounds that come of in people&amp;rsquo;s reels, I can say I hate it (I do not hate anything). I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anyone laughing to those laughing sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For our GIS course, we learned some really cool things, about map projections and cartography. I&amp;rsquo;ve used projections in QGIS earlier but never really knew how it works. We did cartography project as a group, which I really enjoyed. Below is our final map assigned area in our campus, that we made with hands. It feels good to make your first maps with your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/images/cartography_map.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cartography_map&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For distance measurement we used google earth; of course we were allowed since it was a short project. It helped me learn what really matters in a map-what to discard and what to preserve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Why looking at stars made Earth more important</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/static/history/alsj/a11/AS11-36-5333HR.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Earth View - Image by NASA&#34; &gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;Image Courtesy: NASA- &#34;Earth View&#34; - Apollo 11 Image Library &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was always fascinated by stars, planets, and the possible life out there. I still remember when I was a kid; my great-grandpa passed away, I was told by somebody that he had now become a star in the sky. Maybe it was my grandpa itself who implanted all these stories in me.&#xA;Now, every time I look at the sky, the same feeling comes along with every gaze I take. There is awe and fascination only. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never got the chance, just take a look &lt;a href=&#34;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; every day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not think this is me only, I am sure there are a lot of people around the world who feel the same. We all want to know, where we came from. What are we doing here? And Is there anyone out there or are we alone? Questions like this will come to mind.&#xA;We all want to go out and look for answers to all these gigantic questions. This is what humans have been doing all along, we went on voyages and sailed around the world. This is how we have found new continents, new people, new things. But our journey has not yet ended yet and we are still looking for the answers to the same questions, but now our ambitions are much bigger. We want to look on, at new planets, and new galaxies that we have found, and answers to the same questions. I would vehemently support such enquiries and will also participate in such endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there is one thing I have observed over the years and it also bothers me some time. This may be mine and mine opinion only and I may not be correct. In search of all these answers we have forgotten our home, &amp;ldquo;The Earth&amp;rdquo;. People want to move to Mars, terraform Venus etc., it&amp;rsquo;s like they want to escape from the problems we have here on Earth. With the advent of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and all these problems, we seem to be overwhelmed and as the natural human instinct, we may want to just flee. Ideas like colonising Mars are great but they are not going to solve our problems, that&amp;rsquo;s the reality and we need to face it. We are not going anywhere at least in the short run of some hundreds of years and even If we may have the means, the earth will always be our home. I would never want to leave our home and not to return one day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ll present some arguments why leaving the earth is not possible but it is the most foolish idea one could have:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earth is our home, we were born here, and our ancestors lived here, and died here. Even explorers don&amp;rsquo;t just trash out their homes and just leave to look for another place. We explorers, wander around the world, looking for new things but in the end, we return to our home and take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is so much to explore on Earth that may be outside of Earth. We have such vast oceans that we have barely explored, still to this day every single time researchers take a dip into deep oceans, we&lt;a href=&#34;https://oceancensus.org/publications/press-release-the-ocean-census-discovers-over-800-new-marine-species/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt; find new species&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; that no one could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as we know to this date, there is only one confirmed place where life exists, it&amp;rsquo;s our pale blue dot &amp;ldquo;The Earth&amp;rdquo;. Why are we looking out there for something when we are living surrounded by it? There are so many different kinds of life, our understanding of them has just barely scratched the surface. There are around 8.7 million species we have discovered to this date and one amazing part is that the estimates suggest that 80% of species are yet to be discovered.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Taxonomic catalogues are still incomplete for well-known species, and researchers are still finding species so rare that as soon as they find them, they go extinct. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of June 2024, only 26.1% of the global seafloor has been mapped, we still know so less about our waters, we may have mapped stars and galaxies but we still have a long way to go when it comes to oceans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mapping the seafloor is one thing, actually figuring out what life is there is another thing. Estimates show that there may be between 700,000 and 1 million species in the ocean. These are mostly animals and exclude most microorganisms, which are estimated to be in millions. This means that two-thirds of these are yet to be discovered and around 2000 new species are found and accepted every year.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We still don&amp;rsquo;t know how the earth&amp;rsquo;s core exactly works and researchers keep finding new things. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Researchers recently found out that the earth&amp;rsquo;s core changes shape and its rate of rotation over decades and how researchers figure that out is more interesting.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We still don&amp;rsquo;t properly understand how the earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field works and how it stayed for billions of years. If you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the magnetic field then you should because, the theory says that life exists on Earth because has a magnetic field, otherwise we would have been some barren planet like Mars with no atmosphere and fried by the radiation from Earth. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is the clouds, we all see them, and feel them but do we understand them, NO! Clouds are much complicated than we think and they give a very hard time to meteorologists who are trying to predict weather. Clouds and aerosols are one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in all weather and climate models. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the things from the top of my head, that fascinate and puzzle me about the earth. Understanding and solving problems on earth will not only save us but may open new doors of understanding about the universe. We do not need to go to Mars and figure out &amp;ldquo;Novel ways of dying&amp;rdquo; as Sabine said, we need to think and solve our problems here, which will open the doors for the whole universe. I would end with just one line,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A good journey starts from home&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/news.2011.498#:~:text=There%20are%208.7%20million%20eukaryotic,of%20marine%20species%20remain%20undiscovered&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/news.2011.498#:~:text=There%20are%208.7%20million%20eukaryotic,of%20marine%20species%20remain%20undiscovered&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214016182&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214016182&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/explored.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/explored.html&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://scitechdaily.com/ai-powered-breakthroughs-illuminate-earths-core-mysteries/#:~:text=Despite%20this%20basic%20understanding%2C%20many%20details%20remain,iron%2C%20which%20could%20impact%20the%20geodynamo%20effect&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://scitechdaily.com/ai-powered-breakthroughs-illuminate-earths-core-mysteries/#:~:text=Despite%20this%20basic%20understanding%2C%20many%20details%20remain,iron%2C%20which%20could%20impact%20the%20geodynamo%20effect&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01642-2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01642-2&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.mit.edu/2020/origins-earth-magnetic-field-mystery-0408&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://news.mit.edu/2020/origins-earth-magnetic-field-mystery-0408&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/12/5/nwaf082/8051343&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/12/5/nwaf082/8051343&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01460-y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01460-y&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>My Radio memories</title>

      <guid>https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/writings/07-my-radio-memories/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated with the radio, and I always was, although there are differing reason today and when I was a kid. I remember those old Ramsons radios which was like having an iPhone at that time. There were some brands I never figured out, but they also worked flawlessly, just a minor tradeoff in sound quality. I remember me figuring out the best place to figure out the best signal. Sometimes it used to work only if your body is in contact with the antenna, the second you remove your hand, it ruined your favorite song. I somehow figured out that if you rig the antenna of a radio with the TV antenna (&lt;em&gt;Yagi antenna-&lt;/em&gt; I did not know the name at that time) then it worked like a charm. All the channels that used to play modern songs like Red FM, Radio city etc.; frequencies were on my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then over time as TV got more popular and then phones, smartphones took over, the radio got lost, until one day I found one catching dust. It was a Ramsons model, but the string that connects tuner to external tuning knob was broken but overall, it was in good shape. I opened it, half of the solders had come out and half the wires I broke in the process. It used to work on the big D size batteries which is almost impossible to come by, but I got the info about the voltage, and I knew I can manage with a phoneâs battery if I manage to solder one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/images/radio.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image of Radio&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first challenge was to figure out which wire goes where and that proved to be the most daunting task. I figured out the transistor model and then after a lot of google searches and research I found the schematics of it. It took some time to figure out what each component of the board does. It took me a few days to tweak connections and play with solder then one day I actually made it work. It was all static, no sound, no music or anything. I totally forgot about the antenna, I took a aluminum wire and used it as an antenna; and here we are, my radio was working. I was able to tune to like 4-5 channels, at night I got few more. I was so happy and for few days I only listened to it, my mom was thinking I had gone mad, but people do not realize that satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I did not manage to close it properly because the external tuner knob and the tuner inside had this complicated pully-spring kind of system and some parts of it were missing. Then I got busy with all the other stuff, and it again went catching dust somewhere. I had some plans to build my own radio from scratch someday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently got interested in radio again because I got tired of listening to the same kind of music. I realized that radio used to give you exposure to new and random music taste but now I am stuck in my own filter bubble. Whether I use Spotify, YouTube, whatever they are all same algorithms. It trapped me in my own music bubble, and I am tired of it. I wanted something new, something surprising and then I tuned to the radio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently I am playing around with an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;RadioGarden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;, although I have used it before but I am again gone back to using it. You get a map of a lot of radio stations around the world as little-little dots and then you can just play around. I found it so cool, not only do you find something new, but you also get to know what people are listening to around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found this channel called &lt;em&gt;Ujala Radio&lt;/em&gt; which is an Amsterdam, and I am addicted to it (&lt;em&gt;not because it bear resemblance to my name&lt;/em&gt;). First, I was surprised by a Hindi channel in Amsterdam until I realized there are many around the world. I looked for places in US, Canada because I knew that a lot of Indians live there, and I found more. I like radio garden, although sometimes ads are annoying but If I had money, I might have paid for it as well, but it does not interrupt your music like Spotify does. It also has a very beautiful website as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the channels I am listening to these days:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/listen/ujala/sCFHyXDN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Ujala Radio&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;         &lt;em&gt;Amsterdam, Netherlands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/listen/radio-sbs/HASfWUI8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Radio SBS&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;           &lt;em&gt;Utrecht, Netherlands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/listen/sangeet-radio-fm-95-1/3UYywf2B&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Sangeet Radio&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;em&gt;Houston, US&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/listen/radio-zindagi-am-540/zDDJjS8Z&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Radio Zindagi&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     &lt;em&gt;Edison, US&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://radio.garden/listen/radio-privet/AAtNsdFf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Radio Privet&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;em&gt;Nytva, Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not just &lt;em&gt;RadioGarden&lt;/em&gt;; I am also playing with the local radio on my smartphone, but you need more patience for that because you canât be moving around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>I&#39;ve finally got my own domain</title>
      <link>https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/writings/06-i-got-my-own-domain/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/writings/06-i-got-my-own-domain/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I was not particularly obsessed with my name, itâs just that I was curious about finding out how domain works. I have seen a lot of people doing their own thing on their website and I liked that idea. Your domain and website are something you own. I want to own my presence on the internet and here we are â&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ujjwalnagar.com&#34;&gt;www.ujjwalnagar.com&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I started, I thought it will be an easy task to buy a domain; Trust me it turned out to be more daunting than I thought. It took me almost two weeks, just to buy a domain. There are a ton of companies, we all have seen their constant stream of ads on YouTube&#xA;, websites etc. but if you start to investigate what they offer, youâll get to know how murky this domain market is. You will find a lot of companies offering free domain, but when you see the checkout page, it says that you must buy for 3 years and the first year is free, scam it is âno?â.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yearly price and renewal price are the first thing to look for, how much is their renewal price? And if there are conditions for it. Some of them donât even let you buy a single year plan, most of the time it is bundled with hosting plans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Privacy is another thing to look for. Most of the registrars donât even provide Whois redaction and privacy and these are two different things. If you donât know, whois is basically a public directory which stores all the information related to domain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my friend recently bought a domain, I was curious, so I just did a whois lookup on his domain. All his personal information including his Name, Mobile number, Email address and his Address are publicly visible to anyone. I texted him about this, but he texted me back saying that he canât remove it because that is a paid service, and he has to pay for it. This is common across most of the registrars, they will not tell you until you buy the domain and then you realize.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the same with SSL certificates. Most of these famous registrars sell SSL certificates as add on which can cost half the price of your domain itself. Same problem with this also, you will not realize until you buy the domain. Sometimes they will say free SSL buy there is always a little * attached to it. If you are asking yourself, why do I need a SSL certificate, Iâll explain it to you simply. Have you seen that screen in your browser when you are trying to load a website, and your browser warns you with scary screen that an attacker might hack your information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/images/attacker.png&#34; alt=&#34;Error Image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That happens because your site does not have an SSL certificate, and browsers canât verify if it is a legit website or some spam. This again costs money, yes there are some sites that provide free SSL, but they donât work. Most of these issues are with those registrars that spend so much on ads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to do Whois lookup on famous sites, which registrar they are using, then I did a lot of research on registrars on what they are offering, read a lot of reviews on reddit about different registrars. All this research led to Cloudflare; I was really surprised to know that you can buy domain from Cloudflare. I have used Cloudflare only for their DNS, but most people will remember Cloudflare for their âI am not robotâ or website security verification banner that comes before you load a website. I found Cloudflare good, their documentation and everything was very clear and there was no colorful message to deceive you. Most of the domain costs around $10.5 which is cheap when you compare to other registrars and renewal is also constant for every successive year. Apart from this they also give you SSL and privacy redaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this seemed good but when I tried to purchase, I ran into payment issues. First it does not support Rupay card, only international cards are supported and PayPal. Iâve tried 4-5 credit, debit card everything nothing worked. Iâve raised a ticket no one replied. I asked in their community forum and on Discord server, one person replied but that was not helpful at all and then everyone stopped replying. After trying for 1 week every day, I decided to move on from Cloudflare. Later they emailed me all these issues are because of new RBI policies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I moved to Porkbun, they are the only second registrar I found that provides SSL and privacy. I tried to register through Porkbun but that also failed. So, they have this thing where you must scan your ID and take a selfie to get verified, it is all automated. It got rejected. I asked their support team they sent me another link to verify; again failed. I was really frustrated and at this point I wanted to drop my plan. This last time I wrote to them and Walla, they just directly approved my Id. After that it only took max 15 mins to purchase my domain. They use Stripe as their payment processor which works well and the funny part is Porkbun itself uses Cloudflare DNS. You also get email forwarding for your domain. So, my new email address will be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:contact@ujjwalnagar.com&#34;&gt;contact@ujjwalnagar.com&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Iâll later talk about how I point it to my website, how I am hosting it, CNAME records etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Hello, Internet</title>
      <link>https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/writings/01-hello_internet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.ujjwalnagar.com/images/flower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;flower&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about it for quite a while and today I have decided to give it a try. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a lot of conversation with one of my good friend Rishabh and he is the one to give me the final nudge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes! I am starting to write on the internet, you may call it a blog or whatever but for me it&amp;rsquo;s just a way to share ideas. This happened after a lot of debate with Rishabh, and I finally do agree that it is necessary to share ideas as he put it as emitting signals in the world of noise. I am more of a listening person and most of the time I do not have much to say. Problem is people talk a lot, and you need to be very careful to not miss the real part from all the noise. In midst of all of that, there is always very little time to say and even if you do want to say hardly anyone wants to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another problem is about opinions, we all have our own opinions, and every opinion matters even if you don&amp;rsquo;t agree with it but sometimes they are not welcomed. Here from time to time I will be sharing my opinions and thoughts on things, you do not have to necessarily agree with me, sometimes even I do not agree with my own. Although I will try my best but if my opinions do hurt anyone and are not at all acceptable, do point it out on my e-mail. Right now, I do not have any preplanned ideas what I am going to do here, you can take this as a place where I share. I am sure you will something worth reading here and hopefully It will contribute into something good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to 2025 and hope it will bring good days and joy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
