      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/kurt.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I am writing this post on December 24, 2024, there are around 110 conflicts going on around the world as per &lt;a href=&#34;https://geneva-academy.ch/galleries/today-s-armed-conflicts&#34;&gt;Geneva Academy&lt;/a&gt;. This is not new; humans have always used violence to settle their disputes and disagreement but the kind of world we live in can be lethal for humanity. We have two major wars going on right now, the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Palestine conflict and then are many civil wars like one in Sudan which has claimed countless lives and inflicted endless suffering. Now we have our politician&amp;rsquo;s glorification of war from the politicians of all sides, I do not know if they are lying, or they truly believe that. I think it is time to pause for a second and think what are we doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
